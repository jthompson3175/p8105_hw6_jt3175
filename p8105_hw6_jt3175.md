## Problem 1

Load and clean the data for regression analysis (i.e. convert numeric to
factor where appropriate, check for missing data, etc.).

We load and clean the data for regression analysis, and find that there
are no missing values in any of the columns. We also recode and convert
*babysex*, *frace*, *malform*, and *mrace* to factor variables.

``` r
birthweight = read_csv("./data/birthweight.csv") 
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

``` r
# check for missing data

ismissing = map(.x = birthweight, ~ sum(is.na(.x))) %>%  # why do you need the ~ ?!?
  bind_cols()

# male = 1, female = 2
# 1 = White, 2 = Black, 3 = Asian, 4 = Puerto Rican, 8 = Other, 9 = Unknown
# 0 = absent, 1 = present
# 1 = White, 2 = Black, 3 = Asian, 4 = Puerto Rican, 8 = Other

# Recode variables to make sense

birthweight = birthweight %>% 
  mutate(
    babysex = recode(babysex, `1` = "male", `2` = "female"),
    frace = recode(frace, `1` = "white", `2` = "black", `3` = "asian", `4` = "puerto rican", `8` = "other", `9` = "unknown"),
    malform = recode(malform, `0` = "absent", `1` = "present"),
    mrace = recode(mrace,  `1` = "white", `2` = "black", `3` = "asian", `4` = "puerto rican", `8` = "other")
  )

# change the above recoded variables into factors with levels corresponding to the above order

birthweight = birthweight %>% 
  mutate(
    babysex = factor(babysex, levels = c("male", "female")),
    frace = factor(frace, levels = c("white", "black", "asian", "puerto rican", "other", "unknown")),
    malform = factor(malform, levels = c("absent", "present")),
    mrace = factor(mrace, levels = c("white", "black", "asian", "puerto rican", "other"))
  )
```

Propose a regression model for birthweight. This model may be based on a
hypothesized structure for the factors that underly birthweight, on a
data-driven model-building process, or a combination of the two.
Describe your modeling process and show a plot of model residuals
against fitted values – use add\_predictions and add\_residuals in
making this plot.

We used a hypothesized structure consulting literature for the factors
that underly birthweight to reduce our number of potential predictors.
We will continue with the following: gender (*babysex*), mother’s BMI
(*ppbmi*), mother’s height (*mheigth*), cigarettes smoked per day
(*smoken*), and mother’s age (*momage*). We chose a final model by
fitting an interaction term between mother’s age and number of
cigarettes smoked per day, as indicated by past research. Because the
interaction term is significant and there is evidence in the literature
of interaction between age and smoking, we will keep the interaction in
our final model. We then create a plot of residuals vs fitted values and
find that our points are centered around 0 with no clear patterns that
would be
problematic.

``` r
# interaction between smoking status and age - this interaction term is significant, so we will keep this as our final model

interaction_model = lm(bwt ~ babysex + ppbmi + mheight + momage*smoken, data = birthweight) 
summary(interaction_model)
```

Compare your model to two others:

One using length at birth and gestational age as predictors (main
effects only) One using head circumference, length, sex, and all
interactions (including the three-way interaction) between these

simple_model_given = lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = birthweight)
